  "questionCode": "```javascript\n  @Component({\n    selector: 'my-component',\n    template: `My name is ...`,\n  })\n  export class MyComponent  { \n    name: string;\n  }\n  ```",
  "options": [
    "`My name is {name}`",
    "`My name is {{this.name}}`",
    "`My name is [name]`",
    "`My name is {{name}}`"
  ],
  "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
  "explanation": "In order to bind a dynamic value into a template we use the `{{ value }}` syntax, where `property` can be the name of a public property of the component class, or the return of a function or component method (being the latter discouraged for methods implementing too much logic due to performance reasons). Angular implements by means of its template engine and its change detection machinery all the logic required to _inject_ the values represented by these properties in a process known as _interpolation_.",
